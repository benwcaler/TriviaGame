Had to find a few "magic" functions to get this working just the way I wanted to. eval() and each() saved the day for me. Had a couple of bugs when everything was all said and done, but I was able to fix them quite easily and now it works very well. I realize now I should have put all my question objects in an array - nevertheless, I got it to work without it.
